**Maintenance Roadmap for `rssh connect` Command**

**Description:**

### Objective:

The goal is to introduce a new `rssh connect` command to streamline host connection management. This command will provide users with the ability to list available hosts, select a host interactively, or directly connect to a specified host.

### Roadmap:

1. **Create `rssh connect` Command:**
   - [ ] Implement the basic structure for the `rssh connect` command.
   - [ ] Add logic to list available hosts when the command is executed without arguments.

2. **Interactive Host Selection:**
   - [ ] When called without arguments, the `rssh connect` command should display a numbered list of available hosts.
   - [ ] Prompt the user to choose a host by entering the corresponding number.

3. **Direct Connection to Specified Host:**
   - [ ] Implement the ability to connect directly to a specified host by providing its name as an argument (e.g., `rssh connect hostname`).

4. **Update Documentation:**
   - [ ] Update the project documentation to include information about the new `rssh connect` command.
   - [ ] Provide usage examples and details on how to interact with the command.

### Additional Considerations:

- [ ] Implement error handling to gracefully manage scenarios where the specified host is not found.
- [ ] Consider enhancing the command to support additional options or configurations for advanced use cases.
- [ ] Test the command thoroughly to ensure a seamless user experience.

**Contributor Guidelines:**
